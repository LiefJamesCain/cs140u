Unix is the propritary operating system originally released by AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the early 1970's. Linux is the kernal that grew out of and epanded upon UNIX. When the Linux kernal is integrated with GNU software, it forms a fully fledged operating system known either as GNU/Linux or simply Linux.
