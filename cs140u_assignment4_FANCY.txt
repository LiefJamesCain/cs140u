    The file above contains student records. Use a command line to display the records for the top five students in descending (sorted) order, i.e., with the highest GPA studentâ€™s record displayed first. Show your session

> sort -grk 3 assignment4_studentList.txt|head -n 5 
Art     Pohm    4.00    ECE
Andy    John    3.98    EECS

//\\\//\\\//\\\//\\\//\\\/  QUESTION 2  \\//\\\//\\\//\\\//\\\//\\\
----------------------------------------------------------------------


    Create sample files lab1, lab2, lab3 and lab4.  Once you have created the file, display its content with the cat command. Show your session.

> touch lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4

> echo "sample lab 1 text" >> lab1

> cat lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4
sample lab 1 text
sample lab 2 text
sample lab 3 text
sample lab 4 text


    Combine data in the following files (in this order) and append it to the all.labs files: lab1, lab2, lab3, and lab4. Any errors should be redirected to the error.log file. Since you will have all the files, once you redirect the error 2>, assume that you do not have one of the files that consequently would generate an error, obviously in this case the error.log file will be empty, but to build the command include the 2> as if one of the files did not exist. This whole command will be in one line.  Show your session.


> cat lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4 > all.labs 2> error.log

> cat all.labs
sample lab 1 text
sample lab 2 text
sample lab 3 text
sample lab 4 text

> cat error.log   #will be empty

> rm lab4

> cat lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4 > all.labs 2> error.log   #redo the appending

> cat error.log   #will say lab 4 is nonexistant
cat: lab4: No such file or directory

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Create a file named students containing the following data in your current directory. Each line in this file represents a student's first name, last name, and 3 exam scores. Each line should be regarded as a record containing 5 fields separated by one or more tab characters. You must use the awk command to answer these questions

    Tom Jones 100 90 80
    Nancy Jones 70 80 90
    Terry Sims 55 65 75
    John Terry 75 76 77
    Ruth Maier 100 100 100
    Mike Wolfe 90 95 98
    Dennis Cole 70 80 89
    Ron Maier 90 85 89
    Susan Miller 65 80 90
    Mad Bill 75 65 77
