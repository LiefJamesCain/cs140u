User B's Procedure (Suranjana R)

In order to RECEIVE a hard link, one must:


1) Log in to the Unix system and confirm the working directory
    using the following command at the shell prompt:
    $ pwd
    When logged in, each user is placed in his/her home directory by
    default which is /home/student/UserB or ~/B

2) Display permission settings for the user directory ( which is the current working directory)
    using command ls with options l (long) and d (directory).
    
    $ ls -ld /home/student/UserB  OR  ls -ld 
    
    The default permission string looks like drwx------ which means only the owner
    has all permissions ,other's and group have none.

3) Change permissions for the user directory to allow read and write access by other users (User A)
    or all (a) users

    $ chmod a+rwx /home/student/UserB

    We can confirm the permissions change by using the ls command with -ld option as done before
     The permissions will become drwxrwxrwx            
  
4) Create a new directory for lab4 in /home/student/UserB using command

     $ mkdir lab4
     so the absolute pathname for lab4 directory is /home/student/UserB/lab4
     or ~/lab4

5) Display access permissions for the newly created directory and
    modify if necessary to give read and write access for other users (o)
    or all (a) users which includes owner(u), group(g),other users(o)

    $ ls -ld /home/student/UserB/lab4       (ls command is used with both the long option l and directory option d)
     
    The default permission string will usually give no access to other
    users and group while the owner has all access permissions (r,w,x) (drwx------)

6) Change permissions for other users(o) or all users (a) using the
     following command:

     $ chmod a+rwx /home/student/UserB/lab4
     
     The new permissions will be drwxrwxrwx
     Lab4 is a directory file,not a program file and here the execute bit x
     just grants read access like r does.

7) Confirm changes in permission settings using command

    ls -ld ~/lab4
    
    The owner,group and other users should have drwxrwxrwx.

User A's Procedure (Liam Beckman)

In order to SEND a hard link, one must:


1) Confirm working directory upon logging in

   $ pwd            (/home/student/liam.beckman/)

2) create a new directory called temp
     
    $ mkdir temp    (/home/student/liam.beckman/temp)

3) Create a file called data.txt
     
    $ touch data.txt

4) Set file access permissions for all (a) users
     
    $ chmod a+rw data.txt

5) Move the file to temp directory        

    $ mv data.txt /home/student/UserB/temp

6) Create hard link to data.txt in UserB's directory

    $ ln data.txt /home/student/UserB/lab4/data_2.txt

7) Verify hard link 
    
    $ ls -l /home/student/UserB/lab4/data.txt

    Number of hardlinks should increase by 1

8) When User B accesses his/her lab4 directory (/home/student/suranjana.rangarajan/lab4)
     and uses ls command the linked file will be seen (shows up in green) and User B can display the contents 
     of linked file using cat command.

    $ cat data_2.txt

    ls -l command will display a line of information containing the permission string,owner of file, number of hard links
    date & time it was last modified.
