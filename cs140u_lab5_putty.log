working:

I would actually like to allow people to email to a phone number and
automatically have my program check that email box and fax to that phone
number in the email address (ie: 1520xyz1234@golfbydesign.org).

Is this possible? one.

For instance:  If they emailed to 1520xyz1234@golfbydesign.org, the
email would get picked up by my popg (faxhq program) daemon, see that
the address was 520xyz1234 and fax it to 520xyz1234. (a hardcoded fax
number that could also be used as an email address)

Rather than having the customer have to format their email to in the
standard tpc format (nice for us techies...but it ticks off customers).

a real fast answer is appreciated.
Is this possible to do while still running a cell?
