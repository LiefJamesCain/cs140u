Instructions for Lab 7

This lab has three parts.

These three activities are three little shell programs to create and review,
one called svi.sh and the other uon.sh, the other is the command_menu program
on page 444. Your job is to explain what certain lines of the shell program do.
The last part of this lab is to create the command_menu program. On the first
two programs add your comments about what those lines of the code do after the
symbol, describing briefly what that particular piece of code will do in the
program.  

These are the two programs. Type them in vi, and replace the ???? with your
comments explaining what those lines do in the program. The last command_menu
program you will need to create it and run it a few times, make sure to
change the ie. “You entered A” with other commands or options.

Part 1

wmorales@syccuxas01:~> cat svi.sh

 #!/bin/bash
 # liam beckman
 # 30 november 2016
 # purpose of the program: To both make a copy of a given file and open it in vi

  

  if test $# = 1 # if the number of arguments is equal to one...
     then
     if test -f $1 # ...and if the first argument is a regular file...

     then
     cp $1 $HOME/keep #...then copy that file to the keep directory in the
     user's home drectory, and then open it in vi
     vi $1
     else
     echo " file not found.Try again"
     fi
     else
     echo " You must specify a file name.Try again."
     fi

      Place a copy in the assignment dropbox. Before uploading the script
      svi.sh, make a backup copy, rename it in the linux and call it
      svi.sh.txt, convert it to DOS format using the command unix2dos, then
      transfer it to your computer using psftp or filezilla, then upload it

      upload this first program with your comments in the lab 7 submission
      dropbox

      --------------

      Part 2

      For the first two comment lines, your name and date

      #!/bin/bash
      # liam beckman
      # november 28 2016

      The lines that contain #... are comments to the program, Replace the ???
      with your comments explaining what happens in that line of the program.
      Submit the program with your name using the following command:

      wmorales@syccuxfs01:~> cat uon.sh                  

      #!/bin/bash
      #uon.sh: this program will ????????
      until who | grep "$1" > /dev/null #until the user (frist argument) is
      logged into the system

      do sleep 30 #sleep for 30 seconds

      done

      echo "$1 is logged on." exit 0

       Place a copy in the assignment dropbox. Before uploading the script
       uon.sh, make a backup copy, rename it in the linux and call it
       uon.sh.txt, convert it to DOS format using the command unix2dos, then
       transfer it to your computer using psftp or filezilla, then upload it

       upload this second program with your comment in the lab 7 submission
       dropbox

       --------------

       Part 3

       Create the program on page 444 called command_menu. Run it a few times,
       change options, etc.

        unix2dos, then transfer it to your computer using psftp or filezilla,
        then upload it
